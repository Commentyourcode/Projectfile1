            <p><span class="first-character str">T</span>he Imperial Army was the ground forces of the Sith Empire, and the soldiers of the Empire typically wore black armor and carried blaster rifles into combat.
            Ground forces begin live-fire exercises in the jungles of Dromund Kaas within weeks of their enlistment into the military, and even those non-combatants in the military were trained in the use of basic weapons, survival skills, and first aid. The Army also made use of Imperial crawler tanks, Imperial walkers, and a number of models of war droids.
            Imperial heavy troopers were issued full-body black armor crafted from duraplast, with colored markings signifying their unit or special assignments. Their leg armor was specially designed to preserve mobility and to protect from shrapnel, and while their belt housed extra ammunition and grenades for easy access, the armor's bracers housed environmental and targeting controls, and the readouts on the suit's chest provided medical diagnostics for treating soldiers who were wounded in their armor.
            Heavy infantry soldiers typically wore about a hundred pounds of armor, and most soldiers carried rifles, sidearms, grenades, and five days of rations.
            The typical service period for an Imperial soldier was twenty-five to thirty years.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">Imperial Army rank structure was as follows: Private, Specialist, Corporal, Sergeant, Ensign, Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Colonel, and finally General.
              A fire team typically consisted of two or three soldiers, while a squad ranged from five to ten, and a platoon from fifty to a hundred soldiers. Companies could range from a hundred to three hundred troopers, and a battalion, which was typically commanded by a major, consisted of 700-1,500.
              Colonels commanded brigades, which ranged from 5,000-7,500 soldiers, and the largest standard unit was a division, which ranged from 20,000-40,000 soldiers.A larger unit designated an "Assault Group" or "Operations Group" could be formed from over 40,000 soldiers, which were placed under the command of a Moff or high-ranking Sith Lord for specific assignments and then broken up after the completion of the mission.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character str">T</span>he Imperial Navy was the naval branch of the Imperial Military, and was overseen by the Ministry of War alongside the Army.
            Imperial Navy ranks adhered to the following structure: Private, Specialist, Corporal, Petty Officer, Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, Captain, Group Captain, Commodore, and Admiral.
            The primary vessel of the Navy was the Harrower-class dreadnought, a massive dreadnaught produced by Taerab Starship Manufacturing and measuring approximately 800 meters in length, that required a crew of 2,400 and carried a troop complement of 7,300.
            The Harrower-class was supported by the smaller Terminus-class destroyer, which was operated by 520 crewman and carried only 285 troops, and the even smaller Gage-class transport.
            The two main shuttles used by the Sith Empire were the Imperial shuttle and the Imperial assault shuttle.
            The Navy deployed a number of starfightersâ€”the Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighter and its numerous advanced models were the standard starfighter of the Navy, and they made use of B28 Extinction-class bombers as well as a variety of transports, assault craft, shuttles, and cruisers.
