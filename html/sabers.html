              <p><span class="first-character str">S</span>ith lightsabers were lightsabers wielded by members of the Sith. For the most part, the design differences were minimal, due to the typical modern lightsaber being based on original Sith designs.
              Sith lightsabers almost always utilized synthetic crystals as opposed to the natural crystals favored by the Jedi, a fact they considered to be a mark of superiority. Also, most Sith weapons featured an overall more aggressive design aesthetic. One of the variations on typical Sith lightsabers was the double-bladed lightsaber.
              Being of Sith design, these staff-weapons were sometimes referred to as Sith lightsabers, though were not to be confused with the genuine article.</p>
              <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
              <p class="margin-top-10">The design of these weapons changed greatly over the centuries since the founding of the Sith, sometimes featuring a standardized mold, other times being designed by individual wielders.
              Despite this evolution, they were almost always distinguished by their scarlet bloodshine blades, a result of the red coloration usually taken on by synth-crystals.
              Ultimately, the Sith wielded these weapons to mock the Jedi, a trait demonstrated by the regularly greater combat effectiveness the aggressive Sith Lords possessed.</p>

          <div class="block" style="margin-left: 10vh;">
            <p><span class="first-character str">T</span>he early Sith lightsabers were simply an improvement on the preexisting Protosabers favored by the Jedi Order.
            The protosabers, while leaps and bounds ahead of the original lightsaber prototypes with their unstable blades, suffered from severe issues regarding energy consumption, necessitating a belt-mounted power pack.
            The Sith design introduced an internal superconductor, which transferred the returning looped energy from the negative-charged flux aperture back into an internal power cell.
            With this modification, the power cell would only expend power when the energy loop was broken, such as when the lightsaber cut something, solving the power supply problem.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">The ancient Sith Lords took this miniaturization a step further with the creation of the double-bladed lightsaber.
            These original saberstaffs featured sophisticated designs, effectively a single mechanism with twin emitters on either end of a standard length hilt.
            sLater designs would be considerably simplified, with the result being a double-length hilt consisting of two separate lightsaber mechanisms.
            Of lesser note was the design of the Lightfoil by the Sith-aligned Mecrosa Order, which also miniaturized the standard lightsaber design to create extremely well balanced one-handed weapons.
            However, the defining feature of Sith lightsabers was the use of synthetic crystals, as opposed to the Adegan and Ilum crystals favored by the Jedi. Almost all synthetic crystals used by the Sith featured a red coloration, as a result of the forging process used to create them, though adjustments to this process and manipulations through the Force did result in crystals of different colors.
            Synth-crystals typically produced stronger blades than the natural Jedi crystals, and had the rare potential to "break" the blades of standard lightsabers by overloading the energy matrix and instantly burning out the opponent's weapon.
            However, this added strength came at the cost of blade instability, and loss of maneuverability.</p>
