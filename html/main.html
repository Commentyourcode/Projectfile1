            <p><span class="first-character str">K</span>orriban, known as Pesegam during the reign of Xim, and also known as Moraband during the Clone Wars, was the sole planet in the Horuset system, located across the galaxy from Koros Major.
            It was the original homeworld of the Sith species and a sacred planet for the Sith Order, housing the tombs for many ancient and powerful Dark Lords of the Sith, and containing immense dark side power.
            After the Hundred-Year Darkness, the remaining Dark Jedi interbred with the Sith species and ruled the Sith using their Force powers. After the Great Hyperspace War, Korriban was abandoned and became a barren world. It was the site of a Sith Academy, and became the headquarters of the One Sith.
            It was located near Bosthirda and was situated on the Nache Bhelfia and Kamat Krote hyperspace lanes.
          </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">This remote, foreboding planet was the original homeworld of the Sith species. At some point before 30,000 BBY, a Killik colony was established on Korriban, which eventually produced a Killik Sith warrior. The insectoid colonists were swiftly driven off by the Sith.
            The Rakata invaded Korriban in an attempt to integrate the world into the Infinite Empire around 27,700 BBY, intending to harvest slaves from the planet to be used for Rakatan projects. The sole artifact to survive this era was the ancient Star Map, around which the tomb of Naga Sadow was later built.
            The Rakata were eventually forced off the world after the Sith King Adas led his people against them. Adas died in the battle, and thus, despite this victory, the Sith society crumbled, and, in the ensuing centuries of strife, the Sith relocated to worlds such as Arbra, Ziost, and Tund, using captured Rakatan vessels, leaving Korriban as a graveyard world populated only by religious fanatics.
            The world was at least a nominal member of Xim's empire from around 25,126 BBY until its fall, and was given the name Pesegam.</p>

            <p style="height: 50px; font-size: 16pt;">"This is the most important one for now, since it's home to the capital of the Empire."</p>
            <p><span class="first-character str">D</span>romund Kaas was the third planet in the Dromund system, a star system in the Sith Worlds region of the Outer Rim Territories's Esstran sector.
            Originally a colony of the Sith Empire, its location was lost by the time of the Great Hyperspace War with the Galactic Republic, but the Sith Emperor led his people on a twenty-year odyssey that ended with the rediscovery of Dromund Kaas in 4980 BBY.
            The Emperor and the remnants of the shattered Sith society reconstituted the Sith Empire with Dromund Kaas as its capital, taming the planet's savage jungles and building up their Empire's strength from the skyscrapers of Kaas City.
            Dromund Kaas remained safe from Republic reprisal when the Empire launched the Great Galactic War in 3681 BBY, though a Republic invasion fleet assaulted the Imperial capital in 3640 BBY during the Galactic War with the Empire, while a Jedi Knight fought and defeated the Emperor in personal combat.
          </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">The reconstituted Empire eventually dissolved before 2000 BBY, and Dromund Kaas' jungles gave way to murky swamps over the centuries as the planet's location once again fell into obscurity.
            A major battle of the New Sith Wars was fought on Dromund Kaas, and several decades later, the rogue Sith Lord Darth Millennial established the Dark Force religion on Dromund Kaas after he rejected the Rule of Two and abandoned the Order of the Sith Lords.
            The Prophets of the Dark Side, who followed Millennial's religion, ruled Dromund Kaas for almost a thousand years before they incurred the wrath of Darth Sidious, causing the Prophets to abandon the planet for Bosthirda.
            Despite its relative obscurity, the planet became embroiled in the galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, but the powerful influence of the dark side of the Force on Dromund Kaas continued to draw both Jedi and Sith to the planet over the next several decades.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character str">K</span>aas City was the capital city of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, the subsequent Cold War and Galactic War, established in a jungle environment on the Sith capital world of Dromund Kaas.
            After the destruction of the previous Sith Empire in the Great Hyperspace War, the remnants of the Sith eventually settled on the remote planet of Dromund Kaas.
            This led to Kaas City's rise from a small settlement into a massive metropolitan area that served as the home of many important Sith Lords, most notably the Sith Emperor and the members of his Dark Council.
          </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">At the end of the Great Hyperspace War, the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order emerged triumphant against the Old Sith Empire. Unwilling to allow the Sith any chance of threatening the peace of the Republic ever again, the Supreme Chancellor dispatched a combined force of Jedi and Republic troops to annihilate the remnants of the Sith on Korriban and other Sith worlds. This led to the brutal genocide of millions of Sith and Imperial citizens across the old Empire. While this action effectively broke the power of the Sith for centuries to come, what remained of the Sith were able to flee deep into hiding. In search of a new homeworld, the Sith eventually rediscovered Dromund Kaas, a forgotten colonial world of the Sith Empire. Deep within a jungle, the last of the Sith established a small settlement that gradually grew into the vast urban center known as Kaas City.

              With Dromund Kaas virtually isolated from the rest of the known Galaxy, the Sith were able to rebuild their strength in Kaas City without fear of being discovered by the Republic or the Jedi. The Emperor worked tirelessly over the span of many centuries, plotting to exact vengeance on the Sith's ancient enemies by slowly and steadily restoring the Sith Empire back to its former glory.</p>
