              There is a lot more to be explored, from the most well known characters to the forgotten LEGENDS.</p>

              <p class="margin-top-10">As mentioned before, in order to find more specific information, you must search for the Legends sources, instead of searching on the surface, the Canon part of the franchise.
              It also means that the best way to catch up is using Comics, games and even animations, which may contain better and deeper stories for a real fan to explore.
              Below you will find a small portion of all the most powerful beings in the Star Wars universe, but still helps to understand a bit more of how the ominous order has been kept for so long aside from the movies.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character str">D</span>arth Bane, born Dessel, was the Sith'ari and the Dark Lord of the Sith responsible for creating the Rule of Two.
            Born in 1026 BBY, he was raised as a poor miner on the Outer Rim planet Apatros.
            After killing a Galactic Republic ensign in a fight in 1003 BBY, Dessel was in danger of being arrested and imprisoned by the Republic.
            With the help of his friend Groshik, he escaped off-world to join the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness. Initially serving as a foot soldier in the Gloom Walkers unit, he was recognized as a Force-sensitive, and taken to the Sith Academy on Korriban.
            Bane, as he had been christened, quickly became one of the best students at the Academy before he lost his faith in the dark side of the Force. Though Bane was able to regain his confidence in the dark side, he lost his trust in the Brotherhood of Darkness, believing it to be a flawed organization whose leader, Skere Kaan, was a coward and a fool.
            Deserting the order, he went to the planet Lehon and studied the holocron of Darth Revan, and, armed with new knowledge, helped destroy the Brotherhood, allowing him to create his own Sith Order. He then instituted a Rule of Two, which stated that there could be only two Sith to avoid the infighting that had plagued the Sith for millennia.
            He also took both the title of Darth and an apprentice named Darth Zannah.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">A decade later, Bane began to worry that his apprentice was too weak to overthrow him and assume the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith, as was necessary under the Rule of Two.
              He began to research the secrets to prolonging his life by transferring his essence to another body, and traveled to Prakith, where he claimed the holocron of the ancient Darth Andeddu.
              After returning from Prakith, Bane was ambushed by a team of assassins hired by Caleb's daughter, Serra, and was captured.
              Taken to Doan, Bane was imprisoned and tortured, only to covertly gain his freedom soon afterward. Encountering Zannah on Doan, Bane dueled his apprentice, who sought to become the new Dark Lord.
              The fight ended in a draw, with Bane escaping and heading to Ambria with Darth Cognus, an Iktotchi assassin skilled in use of the dark side whom Bane planned to take as his apprentice if Zannah proved herself weak and unworthy.
              There, Bane and Zannah engaged in a fateful duel that resulted in the death of the Sith'ari and Zannah claiming the title of Dark Lord. Bane tried to initiate the ritual of essence transfer but failed to control his apprentice's body. Part of Darth Bane's soul lived in Zannah's body after the failed ritual. But the majority of his spirit was thrown into the void, causing him an eternity of suffering. Nearly a millennium later, Bane's Sith Order defeated the Jedi Order and overthrew the Republic.
              His holocron still imparted wisdom through the years.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character str">C</span>Count Dooku was a Force-sensitive Human male Jedi Master who fell to the dark side of the Force and became a Dark Lord of the Sith, known as Darth Tyranus.
            Born into a noble family on the planet Serenno, he was the heir to vast wealth and the noble title of Count.
            Dooku was taken by the Jedi Order as a child and apprenticed to Thame Cerulian. As a Jedi Knight, he took Qui-Gon Jinn as his Padawan and later trained Komari Vosa.
            Dooku was a respected instructor in the Jedi Temple and one of the most renowned swordsmen in the galaxy, surpassed only by Grand Master Yoda and equal to Master Mace Windu. 
            Dooku spent nearly seventy years as a Jedi, but a disastrous battle on Galidraan shook his faith in the Order and the Galactic Republic.
            He fell under the influence of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of Naboo, and left the Jedi Order.
            After learning that Palpatine was secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, Dooku turned to the dark side and became a Dark Lord of the Sith himself, replacing Darth Maul as Sidious's second apprentice. His new master bestowed upon him the Sith title of Darth Tyranus. However, he was unaware that Sidious only considered him a temporary apprentice.
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">Reclaiming his birthright as Count of Serenno and his vast fortune, Dooku conspired with Sidious to force the galaxy into a war that would bring the Sith to power.
            He forged ties between corporations and planets discontented with the Republic, and became the leader of the Separatist movement that coalesced into the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Thousands of star systems flocked to Dooku's banner and seceded from the Galactic Republic.
            As the political leader of the Confederacy, Dooku led the organization against the Republic in a conflict that would become known as the Clone Wars.
            He recruited and trained four of his greatest warriors to lead the Separatist Droid Army: Durge, the brutish Gen'Dai bounty hunter; Asajj Ventress, Dooku's protégé and Dark Jedi apprentice; General Sev'rance Tann, Chiss commander and Dark Acolyte; and General Grievous, the infamous Jedi-slaying Kaleesh-cyborg and droid leader.</p>

          <div class="block" style="margin-left: 15vh;">
            <p><span class="first-character str">D</span>arth Talon was a female Lethan Twi'lek who became a Sith Lady in Darth Krayt's One Sith in 137 ABY.
            Talon was styled with black Sith tattoos covering her body including her head and lekku; each tattoo had been earned in ritual combat and inscribed by Krayt himself.
            As a Sith apprentice, she was trained by a fellow Twi'lek Sith Lord named Darth Ruyn, whom she later killed on Krayt's command with a swift decapitating strike of her lightsaber, shortly before ascending to the rank of a full-fledged Sith in Krayt's Order.
            Recognizing her unshakeable loyalty, Krayt anointed Talon as one of his two Hands, thus making her an extension of the Dark Lord's own will. In this capacity, Talon found herself working alongside her Hand counterpart, Darth Nihl.
            Talon was often tasked with her Master's most important missions, including the capture of the Jedi fugitive Cade Skywalker. She attempted to get him to join the One sith.
            She tried to seduce him to the dark side along with sleeping with him to form a bond and stronger connection to the dark side. She aided his training in the ways of the dark side of the Force, until her apprentice renounced the One Sith.
            (he stabbed her with his fathers lightsaber) Talon always remained loyal to her lord, Darth Krayt, even during Darth Wyyrlok's attempted takeover of the One Sith, aiding Krayt in his recovery and along with Nihl fighting off the Sith who stood between Krayt and his former Voice, witnessing his return to power.
            When Darth Krayt finally fell during the Battle of Coruscant, she entered hiding along with the rest of the One Sith, working from concealment to achieve their goals by less overt means.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">The Lethan female Twi'lek Darth Talon was a third-generation Sith, raised and trained in the Sith Academy on Korriban, an ancient Sith burial world that served as the secret location of the One Sith.
            Under the tutelage of Darth Ruyn, Talon's inherent abilities as a Force-sensitive were honed in order to transform her into a Sith assassin.
            Psychologically, she was molded to be completely susceptible to the tenets of the One Sith.
            Her ultimate loyalty, however, belonged without question to her order's founder, Darth Krayt, Dark Lord of the Sith and emperor of a new Sith Empire.
            On the verge of her training's completion, Talon was greatly immersed within the dark side of the Force.
            Her final test of loyalty was to slay Ruyn in cold blood. Obedient to the will of Darth Krayt without question, the apprentice did not hesitate when she killed her own Master.
            With her final rite of passage fulfilled, Talon was elevated to the rank of Hand, thus making her one of the Emperor's most trusted assassins.</p>
